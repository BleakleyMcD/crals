# Community Resource for Archivists and Librarians Scripting

 Our community resource is intended to provide helpful one-liners and script code specifically drawn from real-life examples in archives and libraries. Take these, use them in your workflows, change them up, contribute back! Remember: you have to crawl before you walk. (See what we did there with the acronym?)
 
 This is just the beginning! Check it out on the web here: http://dd388.github.io/crals/
 
 We plan to add documentation soon, so if you have an idea for a command/explanation you'd like to contribute, feel free to add it as an Issue for now.
 
Created by Jarrett Drake and Dianne Dietrich.
