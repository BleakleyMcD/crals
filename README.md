# Community Resource for Archivists and Librarians Scripting

 Our community resource is intended to provide helpful one-liners and script code specifically drawn from real-life examples in archives and libraries. Take these, use them in your workflows, change them up, contribute back! Remember: you have to crawl before you walk. (See what we did there with the acronym?)
 
 This is just the beginning! Check it out on the web here: http://dd388.github.io/crals/
 
 We plan to add documentation on how to add your own comments soon, so if you have an idea for a command/explanation you'd like to contribute and wading into the index.html is not for you, feel free to add it as an Issue for now.
 
Created by Jarrett Drake and Dianne Dietrich.
